monday was a very interesting day, it was my first day of uni, i woke up pretty early in the night, i had a call from dad and i woke up suddenly but managed to go back to sleep and wake up a few hours later to call them to have a chat. 

Dadand mum are both doing great, they told me how Ethiopia work industry is in a strain and everyone is fighting hard to make a living there, i still hope the best for my country  i want to see it grow in good ways without racial discrimination or biases but now it feels like it is against me and my family because we come from Amhara. My kings were and are the conquerors and lions of Judah, why should i fear what i would be called and shunned from work for being me, mum and dad wont mention these things because they never wanted me to grow up with a bad understanding of race but the news i see does not lie. 

Dad told me that the reason the money didn't get there yet was because of a bank error made by shimelis bank over at germany, hopefully all goes well before the uni payment due date. 

Dad will be starting his research project soon and he told me how he wants the things to look, i have some ideas on using python packages to display those images on a website using the django framework, hopefully i have a better understanding of programming logic by the time he does the data collection. Dad is going great and i am greatful to have bith my Mum and Dad i just did't realize earlier on how much of a cornerstone they were to the life i am living at this current moment and i surley pray for their health & wellbeing, here and the hereafter in Jesus name. 

after the call i went back into playing a game or two of valorant with a bit of research for Dad's project, i  finished of research while watching pastor sofi arguing with "black Jesus" which i found very funny


i prepped and did what i had to do in the morning and went to the shops using my sisters money i won from taking out a cricket, i don't think this was very fair but i got some money to help me through the coming days, 50 dollars gone so fast, i got her 3 different sodas aswell, they tasted nice. on the way back from the shops i got me a bacon and egg panini for breakfast but was low on cash for the coffee, i ended up not getting coffee, ate my breakfast and left to put back the haul. 

my sister shared some of the drinks as she opened them they all tasted nice, we had some chitchat and left for uni, 

> i dont say it but my sister is amazing and grateful she is my sister, she is sorta funny but very annoying i swear, she dont like doing the house work but loves making me do the house work like wtf T-T and may God bless her in all her undertakings and bring her to understand God better in Jesus name I pray

after the grocery drop off i caught the train, it was pretty full and i med it to the city and went to get a large coffee from my favorite shop in the train station and made it to flinders train

i made it to class pretty early and waited for class to start, class was good i met a guy (i already forgot his name) but everything went well and i asked trish how she was after the class and asked if i can submit PDF files, i ended up seeing jackson(need to reconfim) at the end of my class and he is doing well, he now has another job within the ndis and he is finding it well taking care of his partner's father. 

i met thin from uni/sage/42 and luke who now works for sage, i went over to the train station to catch the train back to 42 for the new v3 launch of 42 system, i had a snadwitch made by the team afterwards but some small things to mention during the meeting was things were slightly changing i still don't understand exactly what they are but things to do with the systems and how things function for students. 


after the meeting i fixed my born2beroot project  and got it down for evaluation during my wait i made it to the game cafe to play games and call farah she was ok and happy she was also rushing to go get something done before meeting ruks, i ment Abu  when i came back to 42 and we chatted on politics and other 42 related matter and soon enough i got evaluated by a guy intra goes by liQianhe gave me a 100% and set my other evals for tomorrow. 

i went back to the train station, abu accompanied and we chatted about different things i don't recall any of it but it was good, on the train station i faded back trying to read my weekly notes but i saw a message from farah and i called her back, she had a fight with mom, which i am still yet to find out see how i goes but called and made my way back home and went straight to bed after drinking 2 small glass of milk.
