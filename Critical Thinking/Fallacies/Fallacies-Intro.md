### What is an Argument ? 

#### Premise

an argument is a proposition that consist of a premises and a conclusion. a **Premise** is a word that comes from latin that means "words set before" and is a previous statement or supposition from which another statement follows or can be inferred it is the foundation to build an argument.

##### How to identify a Premise

a premise is the foundational evidence of a conclusion, indicators words and phrases such as "because", "since", and "in light of" can demonstrate the presence of a premise. if  indicator words are absent but evidence is clearly being put forth to fortify a conclusion that evidence can be seen as a premise. there can be multiple premises to support a conclusion.

A few premise words and phrases are:

- Because
- Since
- In light of
- Given that
- Assuming that
- As shown by
- Seeing as

#### Conclusion

a conclusion is the main point or claim that an argument is trying to establish the statement or in this case premise are intended to support or prove. in an argument, the conclusion is what the author wants you to accept based on the given premises. 

##### How to identify a Conclusion

to identify a conclusion, look for the statement that is being supported by other statements(Premises). The Conclusion often follows certain words or phrases that signal the author is drawing a conclusion. 

a few conclusion words and phrases are:

- Therefore
- Thus
- Hence
- Consequently
- So
- As a result
- It follows that
- Which means that
- This implies that
- We can conclude that

###### Examples

1. **Example 1:**
    
    - Premise: All dogs are mammals.
    - Premise: Rex is a dog.
    - Conclusion: Therefore, Rex is a mammal.
    
    In this example, "Therefore" signals the conclusion.
    
2. **Example 2:**
    
    - Premise: Eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly can help maintain a healthy weight.
    - Premise: Maintaining a healthy weight reduces the risk of chronic diseases.
    - Conclusion: Thus, eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
    
    Here, "Thus" indicates the conclusion.
    
3. **Example 3:**
    
    - Premise: The sun rises in the east every morning.
    - Premise: Tomorrow is another day.
    - Conclusion: Hence, the sun will rise in the east tomorrow.
    
    In this case, "Hence" signals the conclusion.
    

### Practice Example

Consider this passage and identify the conclusion:

- "Studies have shown that people who get at least 7 hours of sleep each night perform better on cognitive tasks than those who get less sleep. Therefore, getting enough sleep is crucial for optimal cognitive performance."



### Things to note with Arguments

###### Building an argument

[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=197&v=EYIlGsL4W4E) - if both your premise of the argument are true then your conclusion should be correct known as a sound argument. There can be times when the one of the premises of an argument is correct and the other a lie but can only give a good argument. 

###### Good Argument

A good argument is broader than a sound argument and can apply to both deductive and inductive reasoning. A good argument generally satisfies the following criteria:

1. **Validity (if deductive):** The conclusion logically follows from the premises.
2. **True Premises:** The premises are true or at least highly plausible.
3. **Relevance:** The premises are relevant to the conclusion.
4. **Sufficiency:** The premises provide enough support for the conclusion.

An argument can be considered good even if it is inductive, meaning that the premises provide strong, but not conclusive, support for the conclusion.

###### Sound Argument

A sound argument is a specific type of deductive argument that meets two key criteria:

1. **Validity:** The argument is valid, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.
2. **True Premises:** All the premises are actually true in the real world.

For an argument to be sound, it must be both valid and have all true premises. Therefore, a sound argument guarantees the truth of the conclusion.

**Example of a Sound Argument:**

- **Premise 1:** All humans are mortal.
- **Premise 2:** Socrates is a human.
- **Conclusion:** Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

This argument is valid (the conclusion logically follows from the premises), and both premises are true, making it a sound argument.

###### Key Differences

1. **Type of Reasoning:**
    
    - **Sound Argument:** Specifically a valid deductive argument with true premises.
    - **Good Argument:** Can be either deductive or inductive and generally provides strong support for the conclusion.
2. **Premises:**
    
    - **Sound Argument:** Requires premises to be actually true.
    - **Good Argument:** Requires premises to be true, highly plausible, and relevant, providing sufficient support for the conclusion.
3. **Conclusion:**
    
    - **Sound Argument:** The conclusion is necessarily true if the argument is sound.
    - **Good Argument:** The conclusion is well-supported and likely true, but not necessarily guaranteed, especially in inductive arguments.

**Logical Connection to Premises**:- when making an argument there should be a logical connection drawn between the two premises and the conclusion 
##### Logical Connection to Premises

When making an argument, it's crucial to ensure that there is a logical connection between the premises and the conclusion. This means that the conclusion should logically follow from the premises based on the rules of reasoning.
##### Deductive Reasoning

Deductive reasoning involves drawing a conclusion that logically follows from given premises. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. Deductive arguments are evaluated based on their validity and soundness.

- **Validity:** An argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Validity is about the form of the argument, not the actual truth of the premises.
- **Soundness:** An argument is sound if it is valid and all its premises are true.

**Example of Deductive Reasoning:**

- **Premise 1:** All birds have feathers.
- **Premise 2:** A robin is a bird.
- **Conclusion:** Therefore, a robin has feathers.

This argument is valid (the conclusion logically follows from the premises) and, assuming the premises are true, it is also sound.

##### Inductive Reasoning

Inductive reasoning involves drawing a conclusion that is likely, but not guaranteed, based on the premises. The conclusion is a generalization or inference based on specific instances or evidence.

- **Strength:** Inductive arguments are evaluated based on their strength. A strong inductive argument provides substantial support for the conclusion.
- **Cogency:** An argument is cogent if it is strong and the premises are true.

**Example of Inductive Reasoning:**

- **Premise 1:** Every swan I have seen is white.
- **Premise 2:** I have seen many swans.
- **Conclusion:** Therefore, all swans are probably white.

This argument is strong because the premises provide good evidence for the conclusion, but it is not guaranteed to be true (there could be non-white swans).

##### In Context

- **Deductive Reasoning:** Used when you need certainty. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. Examples include mathematical proofs and logical syllogisms.
- **Inductive Reasoning:** Used when you are making generalizations or predictions based on observations. The conclusion is probable but not certain. Examples include scientific reasoning and everyday decision-making.

##### Summary

- **Deductive Reasoning:** Moves from general premises to a specific conclusion. If valid and with true premises, the conclusion is necessarily true (sound argument).
- **Inductive Reasoning:** Moves from specific premises to a general conclusion. If strong and with true premises, the conclusion is likely true (cogent argument).

Understanding the difference helps in evaluating arguments and determining the strength and reliability of conclusions based on the type of reasoning used.
